This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP related to using the unset() function inside a foreach loop that iterates over an array.  The issue arises from how PHP's internal array pointer behaves when you remove elements during iteration.  The provided example shows two functions: one where the array is passed by value, and another where the array is passed by reference.   The solution explains how to modify the code to correctly remove elements without skipping over others.
